Its the causes of death in the world and its organized in many different ways, such as by age, by gender, by risk factors


We plan to show a graph like https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-number-of-deaths-by-cause to represent the causes of death over the years. When the user mouses over the graph at a certain point, an animated changing graph similar to the one shown here https://external-preview.redd.it/x1cdV5AkvPOFUAMi1Lar_fQQcpG7VcWhUJvdibJPG0U.gif?format=mp4&s=0f7084a21522f721d9e480efd69683a68e985dba will be displayed giving a more detailed view of the data for that exact year.

It will be interactive because it will contain a slider that lets the user scrub through the years
It will also contain extra information on a hover over of each box.
A click on the a box will change the chart to show the time where there were the most death due to the cause.
Finally, there will be buttons that enable the user to switch through different organizations of the data as mentioned above

This will allow the user to explore how the causes of death changes through out history and how different people are affected. 
It leaves the user wondering why the changes occur.
